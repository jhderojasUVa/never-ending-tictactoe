# Never ending Tic Tac Toe

Tired of having a tic tac toe that ends in a few movements? Well, on this one the fun will continue after everything is filled because your oponent can change your row to their so doing a tic tac toe is easier than ever.

## React

This is the example react app that you can find on the Tutorial but with some small changes.

1. Moved everything to functions
2. Added the never ending way
3. Graphical improvements? jejeje, not too much.

## Why?

I used this to rememeber how to do things on React. Still not finished and I know it can be better. So I don't know when or how I will continue with this.

Anyway is free!

## How to start

Easy:

1. Clone
2. Run `npm run start`
3. If you want to build it do `npm run build`

And feel free to change whatever you want.
